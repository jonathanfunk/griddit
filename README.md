## Learning Experience
Eversince I worked on my Instanews Project where I make API calls to New York Times, I wanted to achieve the same effect using Reddit API. This time I chose to work with React. I called Reddit API using Redux Thunk and Redux to create actions such as request posts, receive posts & invalidate.

Because the images differ in size, I wanted my posts to display the same way Pinterest does. To achieve this, I used collumn styles which is something I never used before. I am very happy with the results. Working on this project with React made me realize how fast the library is changing. Just a few weeks ago, I used the React.PropTypes helper but this time it prompted me to use the prop-types library from NPM.

This is a good start for this project. After looking at the API's different response types, I have ideas for more features I would like to implement in the future.
